/**
 * This operation requests that the server search for one or more Managed Objects, depending on the attributes specified
 * in the request. All attributes are allowed to be used. The request MAY contain a Maximum Items field, which specifies
 * the maximum number of objects to be returned. If the Maximum Items field is omitted, then the server MAY return all
 * objects matched, or MAY impose an internal maximum limit due to resource limitations. The request MAY contain an
 * Offset Items field, which specifies the number of objects to skip that satisfy the identification criteria specified
 * in the request. An Offset Items field of 0 is the same as omitting the Offset Items field. If both Offset Items and
 * Maximum Items are specified in the request, the server skips Offset Items objects and returns up to Maximum Items
 * objects. If more than one object satisfies the identification criteria specified in the request, then the response
 * MAY contain Unique Identifiers for multiple Managed Objects. Responses containing Unique Identifiers for multiple
 * objects SHALL be returned in descending order of object creation (most recently created object first). Returned
 * objects SHALL match all of the attributes in the request. If no objects match, then an empty response payload is
 * returned. If no attribute is specified in the request, any object SHALL be deemed to match the Locate request. The
 * response MAY include Located Items which is the count of all objects that satisfy the identification criteria. The
 * server returns a list of Unique Identifiers of the found objects, which then MAY be retrieved using the Get
 * operation. If the objects are archived, then the Recover and Get operations are REQUIRED to be used to obtain those
 * objects. If a single Unique Identifier is returned to the client, then the server SHALL copy the Unique Identifier
 * returned by this operation into the ID Placeholder variable. If the Locate operation matches more than one object,
 * and the Maximum Items value is omitted in the request, or is set to a value larger than one, then the server SHALL
 * empty the ID Placeholder, causing any subsequent operations that are batched with the Locate, and which do not
 * specify a Unique Identifier explicitly, to fail. This ensures that these batched operations SHALL proceed only if a
 * single object is returned by Locate. The Date attributes in the Locate request (e.g., Initial Date, Activation Date,
 * etc.) are used to specify a time or a time range for the search. If a single instance of a given Date attribute is
 * used in the request (e.g., the Activation Date), then objects with the same Date attribute are considered to be
 * matching candidate objects. If two instances of the same Date attribute are used (i.e., with two different values
 * specifying a range), then objects for which the Date attribute is inside or at a limit of the range are considered to
 * be matching candidate objects. If a Date attribute is set to its largest possible value, then it is equivalent to an
 * undefined attribute. When the Cryptographic Usage Mask attribute is specified in the request, candidate objects are
 * compared against this field via an operation that consists of a logical AND of the requested mask with the mask in
 * the candidate object, and then a comparison of the resulting value with the requested mask. For example, if the
 * request contains a mask value of 10001100010000, and a candidate object mask contains 10000100010000, then the
 * logical AND of the two masks is 10000100010000, which is compared against the mask value in the request
 * (10001100010000) and the match fails. This means that a matching candidate object has all of the bits set in its mask
 * that are set in the requested mask, but MAY have additional bits set. When the Usage Limits attribute is specified in
 * the request, matching candidate objects SHALL have a Usage Limits Count and Usage Limits Total equal to or larger
 * than the values specified in the request. When an attribute that is defined as a structure is specified, all of the
 * structure fields are not REQUIRED to be specified. For instance, for the Link attribute, if the Linked Object
 * Identifier value is specified without the Link Type value, then matching candidate objects have the Linked Object
 * Identifier as specified, irrespective of their Link Type. When the Object Group attribute and the Object Group Member
 * flag are specified in the request, and the value specified for Object Group Member is ‘Group Member Fresh’, matching
 * candidate objects SHALL be fresh objects from the object group. If there are no more fresh objects in the group, the
 * server MAY choose to generate a new object on-the-fly, based on server policy. If the value specified for Object
 * Group Member is ‘Group Member Default’, the server locates the default object as defined by server policy. The
 * Storage Status Mask field is used to indicate whether on-line objects (not archived or destroyed), archived objects,
 * destroyed objects or any combination of the above are to be searched.The server SHALL NOT return unique identifiers
 * for objects that are destroyed unless the Storage Status Mask field includes the Destroyed Storage indicator. The
 * server SHALL NOT return unique identifiers for objects that are archived unless the Storage Status Mask field
 * includes the Archived Storage indicator.
